# Auth Flow React-Template

This project is a React-based web application template, designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for building web apps. It features a clean architecture, example routes for authentication, and pre-configured tools for styling and code quality.

## Project Architecture

This application template incorporates the following architectural elements:

- **React with TypeScript**: Utilizing the power and safety of TypeScript in a React environment.
- **Routing with `react-router-dom`**: Demonstrating navigation between different pages and setting up protected routes.
- **Context API for State Management**: Employing React's Context API for global state management, suitable for lightweight applications.
- **Example Authentication Flows**: Placeholder components and routes for Login, Registration, Password Reset, and other auth-related pages, without backend logic.
- **TailwindCSS**: Integrated for utility-first CSS styling, allowing for rapid UI development.
- **Prettier & ESLint**: Configured for automated code formatting and linting, ensuring code consistency and quality.

## Example Files

The template includes several example files to illustrate its capabilities:

- **Navigation**: Basic `react-router-dom` setup in `src/routes`.
- **Authentication Pages**: Example components in `src/pages` for Login, Register, and Password Reset.

## Included Configurations
